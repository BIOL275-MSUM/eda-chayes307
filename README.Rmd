# Influenza rates for COVID-19 vs Non COVID-19 years

## Abstract

With the overall destruction of COVID-19 and the symptoms of the upper respiratory system, another key disease during this time of year is influenza A and B. Both of these diseases are highly spreadable between person-to-person contact, coughing, and touching similar objects. The overall question is to see if there is a difference in trends of infection of influenza between a year prior to COVID, and the current year of COVID

We will be using data from the Center of Disease Control in order to make these key comparisons between the two factors. With the data that we do have, we will be doing an exploratory analysis to truly understand if there is a diminishing trend in the number of infections of influenza while the COVID-19 numbers went up over time.

With these expected results we can determine the plan of action not only to be prepared for flu season next year, but to see how diseases play a role in our society.

## Introduction

COVID has been with us not for a full year now, and we have heard all of the updates of COVID. One thing that we have not heard about is the flu season that we have each and every single year. WIth this very odd time in our lives I wanted to determine what has happened to flu rates.

Did they diminish, or are they at such lows that no one caught on to that point. With the help of the CDC's past data on the flu. I was able to understand a little bit more of what actually occurred. By using this information, we can finally answer the question of what happened to the flu this year?

The data that we will be looking at is called weekly influenza like illness (aka WILI). Influenza like illness is defined in these data sets by having  a fever greater than 100 degrees fahrenheit and having a cough or sore throat. WILI is calculated by combining state specific data and having it weighted by the total population of said state.

This is important because by answering this question we can understand a little bit more about what we need to do to prepare and understand the flu before the next complete flu season occurs.

## Methods

I am displaying data and my presentation by using R studio and R, the current versions that I am using is R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2020), and for R studio we are using R.Studio 1.4.1103 (RStudio Team 2021)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
```

Data acquisition- I used data from the CDC influenza tracking database. This is because it is a trustworthy source for national data of specific disease statistics, I had to determine the two years that we are looking at to compare our influenza data, 2019 our non COVID year and 2020-2021 for our data. From there we get our excel file and determine what weeks we need to use. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020)

```{r}
X2019_2020 <- read_csv("data/2019-2020.csv", skip = 1)
X2020_2021 <- read_csv("data/2020-2021.csv", 
                       skip = 1)
X2018_2019 <- read_csv("data/2018-2019.csv", 
                       skip = 1)

```

Data preparation: When I get the necessary data sets, what we see is that we have a large number of unnecessary information within our tables, so I had to split it up, I took off the weeks that do not correlate due to the fact that 2019 has completed a full year of data, and 2021 has not completed, therefore I had to have both of the weeks correlate in both years.

Specifically I was looking at week 40 of the last full year all the way to week seven of that current year. By using the filter function in the dplyr package (Hadley et al. 2020) we were able to take out those specific weeks.

What we also did was transmute our data, doing this gave us the ability to change the names of the original data, as well as section off the information that we need, and delete all of the unnecessary information that we get from our original charts. Transmute was performed by using the dplyr package once again (Wickham et al. 2020). We also did with our transmute function was change a couple of our variables to give a better appeal in the table, as well as give an actual date due to the fact that we knew the specific week and year, but we had to attach a date as well.
             
```{r}
wili <- 
  bind_rows(
    X2018_2019, 
    X2019_2020, 
    X2020_2021) %>% 
  filter(
    !(YEAR == 2018 ), 
    !(YEAR == 2019 & WEEK < 12),
    !(YEAR == 2020 & WEEK >= 8 & WEEK < 12)
  ) %>% 
  transmute(
    year = YEAR,
    week = WEEK,
   date =  as_date(paste0(year, "-01-01")) + weeks(week),
    treatment = ifelse(YEAR == 2019 | YEAR == 2020 & WEEK < 12, 
                       "Not COVID", "COVID"),
    wili =  `% WEIGHTED ILI`
   ) %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  mutate(x =  1:n())

```

## Results


```{r}
ggplot(data = wili) +

geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = treatment))

ggplot(data = wili) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = treatment), fill = "#C5351B") +
  labs(x = "treatment", y = "wili (number of people)")
```

What we see with our first graph is the total percentage of WILI within both treatment groups, COVID and Not COVID. What we see is a similar result we see not a large difference between both treatments. With our second figure is where we understand a little bit more about our Infection rates.

```{r}
ggplot(data = wili) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y = wili, color = treatment))

ggplot(data = wili) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = x, y = wili, color = treatment)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from=-1,by=10,length.out=6))
                     
```

What we see is this large difference in our influenza like illness rates where we see this super large dip when COVID started to rise, compared to when COVID did not occur, and we see this super large hike in influnza rates, and we need to figure out why. There are many variables and other things.        
## Discussion

This data is super important in our time line. It shows us that with all of the special precautions that we took with COVID-19 influenza rates actually plummeted. This shows that if we are not super close all the time around one another, then our transmission rates will decrease drastially over time.Compared to our non covid time, we see a large up ward trend as the time throughout the flu season preceded.
